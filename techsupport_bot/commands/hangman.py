    A class that represents a game of Hangman.

    The game includes the logic for tracking the word to be guessed, the guesses made,
    and the state of the hangman figure based on incorrect guesses. It also supports
    additional functionality such as adding more guesses and determining whether the game
    is finished or failed.

    Attributes:
        HANG_PICS (list[str]): The list of hangman pictures.
        word (str): The word that players need to guess.
        guesses (set): A set of guessed letters.
        step (int): The current number of incorrect guesses made.
        max_guesses (int): The maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.
        started (datetime): The UTC timestamp of when the game was started.
        id (UUID): A unique identifier for the game.
        finished (bool): Determines if the game has been finished or not
        failed (bool): Determines if the players failed to guess the word

    Args:
        word (str): The word for the game. It must be an alphabetic string without underscores.
        max_guesses (int, optional): The maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed.
